# Gen-AI Cache Rate Model Performance

## Overview

This repository provides a gym environment designed to explore the intersection of Generative AI and computer systems, with a specific focus on cache replacement strategies in CPU architecture. It builds upon the concepts established in the Gen-AI for Systems Gym environment, focusing specifically on optimizing cache replacement strategies for CPU architecture design through machine learning techniques.

Our goal is to develop and evaluate machine learning models that enhance caching mechanisms by integrating learned policies with traditional system designs. The project demonstrates how Generative AI can be effectively applied to system-level optimizations, particularly in the domain of cache management - a critical component affecting overall computational efficiency.

We aim to:
- Train and evaluate ML-based cache replacement strategies
- Generate and analyze cache statistics
- Leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance decision-making
- Utilize an LLM-based assistant for analyzing model performance and cache behaviors
- Experiment with different architectures and embeddings to improve predictive accuracy

## Background

Cache replacement strategies are essential for optimizing CPU performance. Traditional rule-based approaches have limitations, whereas machine learning and generative AI models offer promising alternatives by learning patterns from system behavior and making more intelligent replacement decisions.

This repository explores how various AI techniques can be leveraged to improve cache hit rates and overall system performance through intelligent caching mechanisms.

## Implemented Caching Strategies

### In-Memory Caching

The repository implements efficient in-memory caching techniques that significantly reduce response times and API costs for similar queries. This approach is particularly valuable for applications where reducing latency is critical.

### Semantic Caching

Advanced semantic caching mechanisms store and retrieve cache entries based on the semantic meaning of queries rather than exact matches. This enables the system to identify and utilize cached results for semantically similar but syntactically different queries, improving hit rates substantially.

### Context Caching

For large token inputs, context caching reduces computational overhead by storing frequently used context that can be referenced in multiple queries. This is especially effective for applications that repeatedly use the same large context with different specific queries.

## Performance Metrics

The repository includes tools to measure and visualize key performance metrics:

- **Cache Hit Rate**: Percentage of requests served from cache
- **Latency Reduction**: Time saved by using cache vs. computing results
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduction in API or computational costs
- **Memory Utilization**: Efficient use of memory resources

## Case Studies

The repository includes notebooks demonstrating real-world applications:

1. **Web Service Optimization**: Implementing semantic caching to reduce API costs
2. **High-Performance Computing**: Using context caching to accelerate repeated calculations
3. **Resource-Constrained Environments**: Optimizing cache strategies for limited memory scenarios
